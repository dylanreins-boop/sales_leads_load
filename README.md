# Lead Pipeline

A lead pipeline board for a sales or call team. It:

- **Pulls in leads** from **Facebook Lead Ads** (real-time webhook plus a "Sync Facebook" backstop) and from your **company website** form.
- Shows them on a **pipeline board**: New / Working → Voicemail → Follow Up 1 → Follow Up 2 → Follow Up 3 → Contacted → Booked → Waste.
- Lets reps **disposition** every call. The disposition moves the lead to the right stage and **sets a reminder to call the lead the next day**.
- Shows due reminders as a banner, a badge, a reminders panel and (optionally) desktop notifications.

It needs no npm packages: just Node.js 22.13 or newer. Data is stored in SQLite (built into Node).

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then edit it
npm start                 # http://localhost:3000
npm test                  # runs the test suite
```

## How dispositions work

| Disposition | Lead moves to | Call-tomorrow reminder |
|---|---|---|
| No Answer – Left Voicemail | next attempt stage* | yes |
| No Answer – No Voicemail | next attempt stage* | yes |
| Contacted – Needs Follow Up | Contacted | yes |
| Contacted – Call Back Requested | Contacted | yes |
| Appointment Booked | Booked | yes (confirmation call) |
| Not Interested / Wrong Number / Duplicate / Do Not Call | Waste | no (can be turned on) |

\* Attempt stages go New / Working → Voicemail → Follow Up 1 → 2 → 3, one step per no-answer.
A lead that is already Contacted or Booked stays where it is.

The reminder defaults to **tomorrow at 9:00 AM** in the rep's own time zone. The rep can change the time or
untick "Remind me to call" before saving. Saving a new disposition closes the lead's older open reminders,
since the call has now happened. Leads can also be dragged between columns, or moved with the Stage
dropdown.

To change the stages or dispositions, edit `src/pipeline.js`.

## Connecting Facebook Lead Ads

1. Create an app at <https://developers.facebook.com> (type **Business**) and add the **Webhooks** product.
2. Get a **long-lived Page access token** for the business Page, with the permissions `leads_retrieval`,
   `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_manage_metadata` and `pages_manage_ads`.
   Put it in `FB_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
3. Set `FB_APP_SECRET` (App settings → Basic) and pick any random `FB_VERIFY_TOKEN`.
4. In **Webhooks**, choose **Page**, set the callback URL to `https://<your-host>/webhooks/facebook`,
   enter the same verify token, and subscribe to the **leadgen** field.
5. Subscribe the Page to the app:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v23.0/<PAGE_ID>/subscribed_apps?subscribed_fields=leadgen&access_token=<PAGE_TOKEN>"
   ```
6. Test with Meta's [Lead Ads Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing).
7. Optional: put your lead form IDs in `FB_FORM_IDS` to enable the **Sync Facebook** button. It
   re-pulls recent leads in case a webhook delivery was missed. Duplicates are skipped.

Webhooks need a public HTTPS URL. When testing locally, use a tunnel such as `ngrok http 3000`.

## Connecting the website form

Send each form submission as a POST to `https://<your-host>/api/intake/website`, as JSON or regular form
fields. Recognised field names include `name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `message`,
`utm_campaign` and `form_name`.

- **Plain HTML form:** see `examples/website-form.html`. It includes a spam trap and redirects to your
  thank-you page.
- **WordPress (Gravity Forms, WPForms, Contact Form 7), Webflow, Wix, Squarespace, Zapier:** use the
  form's webhook / "send to URL" option and point it at the same URL.
- Add your site's address to `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- `WEBSITE_API_KEY` is optional. If you set it, send it as an `X-API-Key` header from your server or
  form tool. A key inside a public HTML form can be read by anyone, so treat it as a spam filter there,
  not a password.

If someone who is already in the pipeline submits again (same email or phone), the inquiry is added to
their existing lead's activity log instead of creating a duplicate card.

## Deploying

Any host that runs Node 22 works, such as Render, Railway, Fly.io or a small VPS. Things to check:

- Set `APP_PASSWORD` so the dashboard needs a login. The webhook and website intake URLs stay public.
- Keep `data/leads.db` on a persistent disk, and back it up.
- Set `TZ` (for example `America/Chicago`) so server-side reminder times match your office.
